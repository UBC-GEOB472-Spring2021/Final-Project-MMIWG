Group Materials Submission: Group materials are to be placed online--they will formally be 'submitted', however, in an Individual Submission). As discussed above in Workspaces, your group should have a private repository under which there is a folder called 'final'. That folder should be nicely organized and have files with meaningful names. It should also have:

A README.md file (Markdown guide) (Links to an external site.) that has:
A URL link to the group essay.
URL links to individual HTML files that I should be able to click on and use your interactive visualizations.
Example screenshots alongside each of those individual map HTML links.
The following other files:
Commented code associated with the visualizations (e.g., JavaScript and HTML).
Any Mapbox Studio JSON style files for your maps, if relevant.
